As MobiTracker grows how will you maintain the credibility of legal contracts?
Our team of moderators have tools spanning over the whole of the review and contracts system allowing them to weed out suspicious contracts and we are searching for a reputable 3rd party escrow corporation that will also assist in ensuring your contracts are paid out and will issue a warning to applicants when a contract does not use the escrow system.
If there is no way of perfect moderation are you prepared to be in a position where people will have negative reviews about your service.
We are taking every step in producing the most reputable contract and reputation system available in Star Citizen. This includes internal moderation tools, 3rd party escrow corporations and a contract insurance system upheld by MobiTracker itself.
